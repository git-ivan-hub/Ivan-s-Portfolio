#[Project 1: Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis Model](https://git-ivan-hub.github.io/NASH-Model/)

This is a project I did for my Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics Degree, where I build the NASH Logistic Regression Model

* Data Source: Secondary data gathered by the existing study "Early Detection of Liver Cancer using AI-driven Integration of Clinical, Genomic, and Ultrasound Images." from the University of the Philippines (UP), Los Ba√±os Laguna.
* The model predict the likelihood of a patients to develop NASH
* Algorithm used: Logistic Regression
